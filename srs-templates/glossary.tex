\chapter{Glossary}

Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS,
including acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate
glossary that spans multiple projects or the entire organization, and
just include terms specific to a single project in each SRS.


The following definitions, acronyms and abbreviations are used throughout this document:
\begin{enumerate}

\introdef{CSSE}{\csse{}}
\introdef{GUI}{Graphical User Interface}
\introdef{SRS}{Software Requirements Specification}

Make sure that your glossary is sorted from A to Z.

\end{enumerate}
